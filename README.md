📅 Daily Progress Log

## 🟢 Day 0 (16-12-2025) – Kick-off Session 

Today marked the beginning of the BridgeLabz Core Java training program. I was introduced to the overall training structure, expectations, and learning roadmap. I gained a clear understanding of the Java ecosystem, including JDK, JVM, and JRE. I also set up the development environment by installing Java, configuring the IDE, and learning basic Git commands. This session helped me understand how Java programs are compiled and executed internally.

## 🟢 Day 1 (17-12-2025) - 🔗[Programming Elements](https://github.com/PaarthAgarwal1/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/core-java-practice/core-java-practice/gcr-codebase/programming-elements)

Today, I practiced Core Java fundamentals by writing multiple small programs. I focused on understanding Java syntax, variables, data types, operators, and expressions. I also learned how to take user input using the Scanner class. This practice helped me improve my logical thinking and gain confidence in writing simple Java programs.

🔑 Key Highlights:

Performed arithmetic calculations

Worked on percentage and average calculations

Solved formula-based problems

Improved console output formatting



## 🟢 Day 2 (18-12-2025) – 🔗[Programming Elements (Level 1 & Level 2)](https://github.com/PaarthAgarwal1/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/core-java-practice/core-java-practice/gcr-codebase/programming-elements) 

Today, I strengthened my understanding of operators and expressions by solving real-world mathematical problems. I worked on unit conversions, salary calculations, and distance-time-speed formulas. This helped me improve my problem-solving approach and write cleaner Java code.

🔑 Key Highlights:

Solved unit conversion problems

Implemented salary and billing logic

Improved variable reuse and input handling

Focused on clean and readable code


## 🟢 Day 3 (19-12-2025) – 🔗[Control Flow](https://github.com/PaarthAgarwal1/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/core-java-practice/core-java-practice/gcr-codebase/control-flow)

Today, I focused on control flow statements in Java. I practiced conditional statements and loops to solve logic-based and real-life problems. This day significantly improved my understanding of decision-making and iterative processing.

🔑 Key Highlights:

Used if, if-else, else-if, and switch

Practiced for, while, and do-while loops

Solved problems like leap year, prime number, BMI, and grading system

Improved confidence in step-by-step program execution 

## 🟢 Day 4 (20-12-2025) – 🔗[Arrays](https://github.com/PaarthAgarwal1/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/core-java-practice/core-java-practice/gcr-codebase/arrays) 

Today, I worked extensively with arrays in Java. I learned how to store, access, and manipulate multiple values efficiently using loops. This helped me understand how data is handled internally in Java programs.

🔑 Key Highlights:

Practiced 1D and 2D arrays

Found maximum and minimum values

Calculated sum and average of array elements

Implemented searching and basic data manipulation


## 🟢 Day 5 (22-12-2025) – 🔗[Strings](https://github.com/PaarthAgarwal1/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/core-java-practice/core-java-practice/gcr-codebase/strings) 

Today, I practiced string handling in Java. I learned about the String class, immutability, and various string operations. Solving string-based problems helped me improve my text-processing skills.

🔑 Key Highlights:

Palindrome and anagram checks

Character and word counting

String comparison and validation

Improved understanding of string manipulation logic


## 🟢 Day 6 (23-12-2025) – 🔗[Methods & Functions](https://github.com/PaarthAgarwal1/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/core-java-practice/core-java-practice/gcr-codebase/methods)

Today, I focused on modular programming using methods. I learned how to define, call, and reuse methods to solve problems efficiently. This improved my code readability and structure.

🔑 Key Highlights:

Created reusable methods

Worked with parameters and return types

Broke large problems into smaller functions

Improved maintainability and clarity of code


## 🟢 Day 7 (24-12-2025) – 🔗[Classes & Objects](https://github.com/PaarthAgarwal1/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/oops-practice/java-oops-practice/gcr-codebase/class_object)

Today, I explored object-oriented concepts in Java. I learned how to create classes and objects, define state and behavior, and model real-world entities using Java.

🔑 Key Highlights:

Created real-world object models

Practiced instance variables and methods

Understood object creation and interaction

Strengthened OOP fundamentals


## 🟢 Day 8 (24-12-2025) – 🔗[Constructors](https://github.com/PaarthAgarwal1/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/oops-practice/java-oops-practice/gcr-codebase/constructors)

Today, I learned about constructors and their role in object initialization. I practiced using default and parameterized constructors and understood how constructor overloading works.

🔑 Key Highlights:

Used default and parameterized constructors

Practiced constructor overloading

Improved object initialization techniques

Ensured object consistency and reliability


## 🟢 Day 9 (26-12-2025) – 🔗[Keywords & Operators](https://github.com/PaarthAgarwal1/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/oops-practice/java-oops-practice/gcr-codebase/keywords)

Today, I explored important Java keywords and operators. I learned how keywords like this, static, and final affect program behavior and memory usage.
