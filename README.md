## Core-java-pratice/gcr-codebase/Programing Elements-Assignment
Today, I practiced core Java fundamentals by writing multiple small programs involving arithmetic operations, percentage calculations, user input handling, unit conversions, and real-world mathematical formulas. The exercises helped me improve logical thinking, apply operators correctly, work with variables and Scanner input, and strengthen confidence in building simple console-based Java applications.
