📅 Daily Progress Log
Day 1 (17-12-2025)
Practiced core Java basics including variables, data types, operators, and user input with Scanner.
Wrote small programs to perform arithmetic calculations and formula-based outputs.
Strengthened understanding of logic building, mathematical operations, and printing results to the console.
Gained confidence in writing simple programs independently and understanding how Java execution works.

Day 2 (18-12-2025)

Practiced core Java fundamentals by writing multiple small programs involving arithmetic operations, percentage calculations, user input handling, unit conversions, and real-world mathematical formulas.
Improved logical thinking, applied operators correctly, worked with variables and Scanner input, and strengthened confidence in building console-based Java applications.

Day 3 (19-12-2025)

Practiced Core Java basics by solving many small programs based on real-life examples. Focused on using loops, and conditions to take user input, process data, and display correct results.
This helped in understanding how Java programs work step by step.

Day 4 (20-12-2025)

Focused entirely on arrays in Java and practiced storing, accessing, and manipulating multiple values efficiently.
Solved real-life problem-based programs using arrays and loops to perform calculations and display results.
